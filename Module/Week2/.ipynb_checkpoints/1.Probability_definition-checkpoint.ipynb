However, during most of humanity there was not a formal definition of the mathematics  of chance. \n",

For most of the history of humanity, randomness was mostly attributed to divine intervention thus not really tried to be treated as a mathematical concept. Another problem was the inconvenience of the earlier numerical systems. It was not until the adoption of the indian-arabic numerals that real advances were made regarding the concept and rules of gambling."
